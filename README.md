### Typing Test Website

## Collaborators:
* Peter Bertone
* Claire Mather

## Description:

A simple typing speed test website inspired by MonkeyType. We began working on this project in our Software Design III course, where our group loved to play MonkeyType;
it became a running contest to see who could type the fastest. After some time, we wanted to design our own website, with some changes, for our group of friends.
We hope you enjoy it!
